- when a user types in a letter, check the letter
- if letters are the same, change text-to-type letter
  else do nothing


  so get input from text box

  Read 5 pages of Javascript books
  and use what I learned in those 5 pages in a program
  and document how i am using it. - write sample

Level 1 - each row
for each row - if 


things that might be useful

getElementById()

getElementsByClassName()

document.getElementById('first-row').getElementsByClassName('key')


on page load:
  pick a random letter in a row and change background to blue
  put letter in text-to-type
  if letters are the same, pick a new letter
  else alert whoops you picked the wrong key - try again
